<h1 id="using-git">Using <code>git</code></h1>
<p>This is an introductory repository designed to help understand how the version control program git works and how it can help make collaborating and working on projects easier.</p>
<p>For easier viewing, an <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/using-git-test/blob/master/README.html">html version</a> of the README is also available.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-git">Why use <code>git</code>?</h2>
<p>For any sort of project – not necessarily just programming – a version control program helps keep track of what changes were made to the project. Such programs eliminate the need to manually backup projects, and allows you to see previous versions of your project. Because of this, git is a really popular choice to maintain a project.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>Very simply, git keeps track of your edits in a graph. You can check out nodes of this graph to view the previous edits on the project, or commit new nodes to add new changes. These graphs can then be synchronized to cloud services, like github or BitBucket.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-git">How do I use <code>git</code>?</h2>
<p>We will go over the terminal version of git in this tutorial, although you can do everything mentioned here over in a GUI version of git as well.</p>
<p>If you get lost at any step, you can always check out <code>git --help</code> to see a help page provided by the program itself.</p>
<h3 id="initializing-our-repository">Initializing our repository</h3>
<p>In order to use git, we need to tell it that we intend to use a directory as a project. We use the command <strong>git init</strong> to tell git that we have a project in our current directory:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git init</kbd>
Initialized empty git repository in .../project/.git/
</pre>
<p>When we run the command, we see the prompt above telling us that we created a git repo in the <code>project/</code> directory.</p>
<h3 id="cloning-an-already-existing-repository">Cloning an already existing repository</h3>
<p>If the project you’re going to be working on already exists, you can instead ‘clone’ that project onto your machine. For example, let’s say that you wanted to clone this repository onto your machine. To do this, you would use the clone command of git, and specify a path (either local or online) to a git repository to clone it:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git clone https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/using-git-test</kbd>
Cloning into &#39;using-git-test&#39;...
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 1), reused 4 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
</pre>
<p>Although your prompt may not look exactly the same, this is the output you would get, showing where you cloned the project to, and how many objects you cloned. As an exercise, <strong>try cloning this repository onto your machine.</strong> We will use this repository as an example of how a git workflow works.</p>
<h3 id="adding-changes">Adding changes</h3>
<p>After you either created or cloned your repository, you may want to make some edits and tell git to keep track of those edits. For example, open this <code>README.md</code> file in a text editor and change the line below:</p>
<pre> <kbd> CHANGE THIS LINE HERE </kbd> </pre>
<p>After you have added your changes, you may want to see what changed in your project. To see the current status of your project, just type <code>git status</code>:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
</pre>
<p>Here, git tells you that the file <code>README.md</code> has changed, but you have not yet told it to keep track of the file. To do this, you first have to add the file to ‘stage’ it, i.e. tell it that you plan to send the file. Use <code>git add</code> to do so:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.

Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
        modified:   README.md
</pre>
<p>If you haven’t configured <code>git</code> before, you may need to enter a name and email for git to be able to tell others who made the changes. To do this, you can use the following two commands:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git config user.name  &quot;Your name here&quot;</kbd>
$ <kbd>git config user.email &quot;your@email.here&quot;</kbd>
</pre>
<p>Now, you’re ready to tell git that you have made all the changes you wanted to make, and that you’re ready to send off the changes you’ve made. You can tell this to git by <code>git commit</code>, but to commit your changes, you also have to give it a meaningful message that describes what your commit has changed. You can pass your comment directly while committing with <code>-m &quot;YOUR MESSAGE&quot;</code>, or you can make git open your defined editor with <code>-a</code>. Here, we’ll specify the message <code>&quot;feat: first commit&quot;</code>, and create our first commit with:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git commit -m &quot;feat: first commit&quot;</kbd>
[master 8cef6be] feat: first commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
</pre>
<p>You can see a couple things in this output: the branch we committed our changes to, namely <code>master</code>, the id of our commit <code>8cef6be</code>, and the description we provided, <code>feat: first commit</code>. You can also see how many files we changed, how many characters we added and how many we deleted. This does not necessarily mean we deleted anything, it’s just there because of how git keeps track of changes.</p>
<h3 id="git-branches">Git branches</h3>
<p>You’ll recall that we mentioned something called a branch called <code>master</code> that we’ve yet to mention. We’ve said that git keeps track of your project in a graph, and so an important part of this graph is that it can have branches that diverge at points and possibly merge at other points. We regularly want to work on changes that we do not want to push onto a main branch, so we create other branches to work on our changes, and merge them onto our main branch when we decide that our changes are ready to be introduced into our project.</p>
If you type <code>git branch</code> right now, you’ll see that the only branch we have is <code>master</code>:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git branch</kbd>
* master
</pre>
<p>It is convention that the first branch to be created in a git project is named ‘master’, although this is not necessary.</p>
Let’s say that you have some other changes you want to make, but do not want to push to master. Then what we want to do is create a new branch, which we can do with the <code>git branch</code> command. Let’s say that we want to create a branch called <code>markdown-changes</code>. If you were to just say <code>git branch markdown-changes</code>, you’d notice that no output was produced. So, taking a look at <code>git branch</code>:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git branch</kbd>
  markdown-changes
<kbd>* master</kbd>
</pre>
You’ll see that although we created the branch <code>markdown-changes</code>, we are still in <code>master</code>. To switch branches, or checkout as it’s called in git, we say <code>git checkout markdown-changes</code>, and upon doing so, we’ll get a message saying that we switched to the <code>markdown-changes</code> branch. Creating a branch and switching to it is so commonplace while using git, you can do all of it with a single command:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git checkout -b new-branch</kbd>
Switched to a new branch &#39;new-branch&#39;
$ <kbd>git branch</kbd>
  markdown-changes
  master
<kbd>* new-branch</kbd>
</pre>
