<h1 id="using-git">Using <code>git</code></h1>
<p>This is an introductory repository designed to help understand how the version control program git works and how it can help make collaborating and working on projects easier.</p>
<p>For easier viewing, an <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/using-git-test/blob/master/README.html">html version</a> of the README is also available.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-git">Why use <code>git</code>?</h2>
<p>For any sort of project – not necessarily just programming – a version control program helps keep track of what changes were made to the project. Such programs eliminate the need to manually backup projects, and allows you to see previous versions of your project. Because of this, git is a really popular choice to maintain a project.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>Very simply, git keeps track of your edits in a graph. You can check out nodes of this graph to view the previous edits on the project, or commit new nodes to add new changes. These graphs can then be synchronized to cloud services, like github or BitBucket.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-git">How do I use <code>git</code>?</h2>
<p>We will go over the terminal version of git in this tutorial, although you can do everything mentioned here over in a GUI version of git as well.</p>
<p>If you get lost at any step, you can always check out <code>git --help</code> to see a help page provided by the program itself.</p>
<h3 id="initializing-our-repository">Initializing our repository</h3>
<p>In order to use git, we need to tell it that we intend to use a directory as a project. We use the command <strong>git init</strong> to tell git that we have a project in our current directory:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git init</kbd>
Initialized empty git repository in .../project/.git/
</pre>
<p>When we run the command, we see the prompt above telling us that we created a git repo in the <code>project/</code> directory.</p>
<h3 id="cloning-an-already-existing-repository">Cloning an already existing repository</h3>
<p>If the project you’re going to be working on already exists, you can instead ‘clone’ that project onto your machine. For example, let’s say that you wanted to clone this repository onto your machine. To do this, you would use the clone command of git, and specify a path (either local or online) to a git repository to clone it:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git clone https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/using-git-test</kbd>
Cloning into &#39;using-git-test&#39;...
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 1), reused 4 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
</pre>
<p>Although your prompt may not look exactly the same, this is the output you would get, showing where you cloned the project to, and how many objects you cloned. As an exercise, <strong>try cloning this repository onto your machine.</strong> We will use this repository as an example of how a git workflow works.</p>
<h3 id="adding-changes">Adding changes</h3>
<p>After you either created or cloned your repository, you may want to make some edits and tell git to keep track of those edits. For example, open this <code>README.md</code> file in a text editor and change the line below:</p>
<pre> <kbd> CHANGE THIS LINE HERE </kbd> </pre>
<p>After you have added your changes, you may want to see what changed in your project. To see the current status of your project, just type <code>git status</code>:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
</pre>
<p>Here, git tells you that the file <code>README.md</code> has changed, but you have not yet told it to keep track of the file. To do this, you first have to add the file to ‘stage’ it, i.e. tell it that you plan to send the file. Use <code>git add</code> to do so:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.

Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
        modified:   README.md
</pre>
<p>If you haven’t configured <code>git</code> before, you may need to enter a name and email for git to be able to tell others who made the changes. To do this, you can use the following two commands:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git config user.name  &quot;Your name here&quot;</kbd>
$ <kbd>git config user.email &quot;your@email.here&quot;</kbd>
</pre>
<p>Now, you’re ready to tell git that you have made all the changes you wanted to make, and that you’re ready to send off the changes you’ve made. You can tell this to git by <code>git commit</code>, but to commit your changes, you also have to give it a meaningful message that describes what your commit has changed. You can pass your comment directly while committing with <code>-m &quot;YOUR MESSAGE&quot;</code>, or you can make git open your defined editor with <code>-a</code>. Here, we’ll specify the message <code>&quot;feat: first commit&quot;</code>, and create our first commit with:</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git commit -m &quot;feat: first commit&quot;</kbd>
[master 8cef6be] feat: first commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
</pre>
<p>You can see a couple things in this output: the branch we committed our changes to, namely <code>master</code>, the id of our commit <code>8cef6be</code>, and the description we provided, <code>feat: first commit</code>. You can also see how many files we changed, how many characters we added and how many we deleted. This does not necessarily mean we deleted anything, it’s just there because of how git keeps track of changes.</p>
<h3 id="changes-sending-and-receiving-changes">Changes, sending and receiving changes</h3>
Right about now, you may want to send your commit to somewhere else, maybe your project is hosted on an online git service like Github. If you cloned this repository, you already have somewhere you can technically send your changes, you can see this with <code>git remote</code>. If you also want to see where <code>origin</code> points to, you can use <code>git remote get-url</code> to see this:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git remote</kbd>
origin
$ <kbd>git remote get-url origin</kbd>
https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/using-git-test
</pre>
Now, let’s say that you have a change in <code>master</code>, and you want to send this change upstream to <code>origin/master</code>. You can then do <code>git push</code> to push your changes (provided you’re currently in the branch <code>master</code>):
<pre>
$ <kbd>git push origin master</kbd>
To https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/using-git-test
 ! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to &#39;https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/using-git-test&#39;
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., &#39;git pull ...&#39;) before pushing again.
hint: See the &#39;Note about fast-forwards&#39; in &#39;git push --help&#39; for details.
</pre>
Uh oh! Seems like there was a change in master that you haven’t kept up with. You’ll get an error like this if you aren’t up-to-date with the branch you want to push to. Fortunately, you can get the recent changes from the upstream branch by <code>git pull</code>.
<pre>
$ <kbd>git pull</kbd>
remote: Enumerating objects: 11, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (11/11), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 8 (delta 3), reused 8 (delta 3), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (8/8), 6.15 KiB | 98.00 KiB/s, done.

Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
</pre>
<h4 id="merge-conflicts">Merge conflicts</h4>
It seems like we still have problems. We were able to get the changes with pull, but it seems like our changes conflict with something upstream. This is called a ‘merge conflict’. We have yet to mention what a merge is, and it will be a bit before we do, but for now, we’ll think of a merge conflict intuitively, i.e., that we had an issue ‘merging’ the upstream branch <code>origin/master</code> and the local branch <code>master</code> during our <code>push</code>. We will not be able to send our changes upstream without fixing all of the conflicts. If you were to check the status of our branch right now, you’d get more relevant information:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
On branch master
Your branch and &#39;origin/master&#39; have diverged,
and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to merge the remote branch into yours)

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run &quot;git commit&quot;)
  (use &quot;git merge --abort&quot; to abort the merge)

Changes to be committed:
        modified:   README.html

Unmerged paths:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to mark resolution)
        both modified:   README.md
</pre>
It seems that the file <code>README.md</code> were edited both upstream and locally. If you open the file, you’ll see something like this:
<pre>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
Changes made locally
=======
Changes made upstream
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6987016029c64cd2a25f1f898cddc688bd94c514
</pre>
<p>The content in between <code>&#39;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD&#39;</code> and <code>&#39;=======&#39;</code> are the changes you made locally and wanted to push upstream, and the content in between <code>&#39;=======&#39;</code> and <code>&#39;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6987016029c64cd2a25f1f898cddc688bd94c514&#39;</code> is what was changed upstream and what you pulled. Notice that <code>&#39;6987016029c64cd2a25f1f898cddc688bd94c514&#39;</code> is the id of the commit you pulled, similar to the one from before, but this one is the full id, whereas the one from before was just the shorter version.</p>
It’s up to us to resolve the conflict, we may want to keep only one change, we may want to keep both changes, or we may have to do more than just pasting; we may have to rewrite parts of our projects in order to fix it. After we’ve added our changes, we can remove the lines
<pre>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
=======
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6987016029c64cd2a25f1f898cddc688bd94c514
</pre>
After we made our changes, we have to stage our files and create another commit. The reason we do this is because we actually ‘merged’ two branches, namely <code>origin/master</code> and <code>master</code> (one is upstream, and the other is our local branch). If you check the status of the branch, you’ll now see:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
On branch master
Your branch and &#39;origin/master&#39; have diverged,
and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to merge the remote branch into yours)

All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use &quot;git commit&quot; to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:
        modified:   README.html
        modified:   README.md
</pre>
Now when you run <code>git commit</code> to resolve the conflict, you can optionally enter a description, but git already creates one for you. You’ll receive the following messages:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git commit</kbd>
[master bb63a61] Merge branch &#39;master&#39; of https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/using-git-test
$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of &#39;origin/master&#39; by 2 commits.
  (use &quot;git push&quot; to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
</pre>
It says that we are ahead by 2 commits. If you want to see what these commits are, you can use <code>git log</code> to see them. Here are the mentioned 2 commits.
<pre>
$ <kbd>git log</kbd>

<h3 id="git-branches-and-merging">Git branches and merging</h3>
<p>You’ll recall that we mentioned something called a branch called <code>master</code> that we’ve yet to talk about. We’ve said that git keeps track of your project in a graph, and so an important part of this graph is that it can have branches that diverge at points and possibly merge at other points, as it was with the merge conflict we resolved earlier. We regularly want to work on changes that we do not want to push onto a main branch, so we create other branches to work on our changes, and merge them onto our main branch when we decide that our changes are ready to be introduced into our project.</p>
If you type <code>git branch</code> right now, you’ll see that the only branch we have is <code>master</code>:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git branch</kbd>
* master
</pre>
<p>It is convention that the first branch to be created in a git project is named ‘master’, although this is not necessary.</p>
Let’s say that you have some other changes you want to make, but do not want to push to master. Then what we want to do is create a new branch, which we can do with the <code>git branch</code> command. Let’s say that we want to create a branch called <code>markdown-changes</code>. If you were to just say <code>git branch markdown-changes</code>, you’d notice that no output was produced. So, taking a look at <code>git branch</code>:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git branch</kbd>
  markdown-changes
<kbd>* master</kbd>
</pre>
You’ll see that although we created the branch <code>markdown-changes</code>, we are still in <code>master</code>. To switch branches, or checkout as it’s called in git, we say <code>git checkout markdown-changes</code>, and upon doing so, we’ll get a message saying that we switched to the <code>markdown-changes</code> branch. Creating a branch and switching to it is so commonplace while using git, you can do all of it with a single command:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git checkout -b new-branch</kbd>
Switched to a new branch &#39;new-branch&#39;
$ <kbd>git branch</kbd>
  markdown-changes
  master
<kbd>* new-branch</kbd>
</pre>
Let’s say that we made new commits in the branch <code>markdown-changes</code> and we’re sure that we want to introduce this commit to the branch <code>master</code>. We can do this by first checking out the branch we have the changes in, namely <code>master</code>, and merging the branch with <code>markdown-changes</code>.
<pre>
$ <kbd>git checkout master</kbd>
Switched to branch &#39;master&#39;
$ <kbd>git merge markdown-changes</kbd>
Updating bb63a61..3405081
Fast-forward
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
</pre>
<p>If you have any problems while merging, git will tell you that you have a merge conflict. This is what git referred to when we tried to push our commit upstream and we were behind. You may have noticed that git had ‘Fast-forward’ in the merge output message. This is not that important for now, but we will get to this later on.</p>
<h3 id="making-mistakes">Making mistakes</h3>
No one is infallible. We all make mistakes from time to time, and there will probably come a time when you’ve made a mistake and want to fix it. For example, we have previously merged <code>master</code> and <code>markdown-changes</code>, and let’s say that since then, we’ve added a new commit onto <code>master</code>. We have later on decided that this commit should not be in our project and wish to remove it. We can use the command <code>git reset</code> to do this. Although reset does many other things, for our purposes, the following command ‘forgets’ our most recent commit:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git reset --hard HEAD~1</kbd>
HEAD is now at 3405081 feat: added things
</pre>
<p>We have not explained what <code>HEAD</code> is, but you can think of it as a pointer that points to either a branch or a commit. All your work is actually stored in this <code>HEAD</code> pointer, and actions like committing depend on it. <code>HEAD~1</code> is just a pointer to the commit 1 before the commit <code>HEAD</code> points to; we tell git to act as if the tip of our branch is <code>HEAD~1</code> instead. If we want to point to the previous commit, we can also use the notation <code>HEAD^</code>, and if we have a specific commit that we want to roll back to, we can just use its id, like the ones from before; both long and short ids will work fine.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you were too late in recognizing your mistake, and you pushed the commit you wanted to delete. In this case, it is extremely dangerous to reset the pushed commit, as other people may have already pulled it to their machines, and the reset may mess with their workflow. Instead, git has another feature that allows us to create another commit that basically reverts all the changes we made in the erronous commit, appropriately named <code>git revert</code>.</p>
<p>This is the basic workflow while using git: we create commits from the changes we make, we push our changes upstream, we pull changes from upstream, and if we have merge conflicts, we resolve them. For a project with multiple maintainers, this turns out to be a more efficient way of working on a project in contrast to working with e-mailing zip files etc.</p>
